# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. 

# What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app was designed as a weight tracking app so that users could keep track of their daily weight.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app required a login screen, a grid screen showing the logged data, and a screen to add weight. The login screen had a login button as well as a register button. There was also a SMS notifications button on the grid screen.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The process of coding the app started with identifying user requirements and a plan for the features necessary to meet those requirements. I started with developing the user interface, which helped guide how I coded the app.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To test functionality, I used the emulator in Android Studio, which was so cool and fun to use. I was able to tell if all of the features were functional and see it exactly as it would appear on the chosen device.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
There were some pieces of the interface that I had to change once I started coding in order to make my app functional. Thankfully, Android Studio made it easy for me to change things around quickly and efficiently.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I really enjoyed creating the user interface. I feel that this was the strongest skill I had in the development of this project.
